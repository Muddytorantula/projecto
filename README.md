Projecto
========

Projecto is a simple project management web application built using Flask and
AngularJS. It is designed for a small team who wants an integrated experience
with everything hosted in one system.

(Coders have Github, what about the rest of the world?)

Documentation available [here][docs]. You can also hangout on IRC with us at
