Projecto
========

Projecto is a simple project management web application built using Flask and
AngularJS. It is designed for a small team who wants an integrated experience
with everything hosted in one system. 

(Coders have Github, what about the rest of the world?)

**Disclaimer**: The state of the code of this project is not the best. The
project grew larger than the initial structure can handle and is currently
under going cleanups.

Projecto is licensed under the Apache 2 license.
